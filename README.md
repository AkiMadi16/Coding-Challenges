In this repository, I'm documenting my journey of coding tests recieved.

🌱 Mistakes and Lessons:
1.  Atlassian Challenge 2023
- [Map JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map )  (Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. ) 
- [Set JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) - Set object (collection of values - A value in the set may only occur once; it is unique in the set's collection.)
[Set JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) 

2.  practice before a challenge because I spent too much time remembering methods. I had to use internet help also it is accepted in Coder Byte!

3. If applying for React jobs then you will get simple React template code challenge to modify application such as  toggle between items in array.
ex - on/off switch using useSate
    onClick function with toggle action using Context API
