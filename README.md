🌱 Mistakes and Lessons:
- Atlassian Challenge - learned Map and Set object (collection of values - A value in the set may only occur once; it is unique in the set's collection.)
[Map JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map ) 
[Set JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) 

  practice before a challenge because I spent too much time remebering methods. I had to use internet help also it is accepted in Coder Byte!
